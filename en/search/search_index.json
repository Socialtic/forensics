Expert investigations are often carried out by police, military or judicial entities. Historically, a lot of the documentation and processes have been developed by these groups in contexts where there is no direct consent for the investigation. </p> </li> <li> <p>Academic investigations: Through academic investigations researchers look to develop new lines and techniques for research that create improvements in the methodologies and generate practical knowledge to advance the forensic science field. </p> </li> <li> <p>Private sector investigations: Private sector investigations are led by internal teams or external consultants, and have the goal of identifying the origin and the scope of possible intrusions and security incidents affecting business or institutions. </p> </li> <li> <p>Investigations to protect Human Rights Defenders (HRDs): In the context of protection to Human Rights Defenders, forensic investigations intend to generate, preserve and present evidence of digital security incidents affecting HRDs. The goal is to enable the victim's access to remediation and accountability mechanisms that reduce the attacker's impunity and expose perpetrators that violate fundamental rights. </p> </li> </ul> <p>Frequently, forensic investigations start when there is a detection of a possible security incident. Although forensic analysis and incident response pursue different goals, consolidating both processes results in a stronger incident handling and containment that is also capable of collecting and preserving important evidence. </p> <p>Incident response is focused in detecting and responding to security events and incidents. Through well defined response procedures, it is possible to minimize the impact and contain the consequences of incidents. For an effective response, it is also important to uncover the root cause of intrusions, so that the threat can be eradicated in a timely manner.  </p> <p>When incident response and forensic analysis are done separately, actions that are taken without adequate coordination can have an impact both and challenge both the response and the analysis. For example, managing an incident without considering the need to document and preserve evidence, can result in damage or destruction of files and artifacts required of the forensic investigation. In a similar way, focusing solely on the forensic analysis, might delay the contention of an incident, resulting in higher severity consequences and a longer resolution time. </p> <p>Therefore, it is ideal to combine both processes in what is often referred to as Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR), so that the response considers best practices for the collection and preservation of evidence, and findings from the forensic research can be used to contain and, ultimately, prevent future incidents. </p> <p>This guide and repository are focused on the forensic aspects of an investigation.

Keep in mind the following: </p> <ul> <li>It is possible that the analyst identifies more sources of information that you have capacity to collect. For example, if you are investigating a potential spyware infection, relevant data might exist in the targeted device, the network equipment, devices from the ISP, online accounts, to name a few. You should prioritize the collection of evidence that, according to your experience, has the greater value and potential for the investigation, and requires a reasonable amount of effort to collect.   </li> <li>Due to its nature, some digital data useful for analysis is volatile, which means it can be altered or destroyed as time passes or when you interact or turn the device off. An example of volatile data would be the list of running processes on a device. In general, it is recommended to prioritize the extraction of volatile data over non-volatile data (like hard-drives and file systems).   </li> <li>Considering the above, the analyst can then make a decision on the best way to extract information from devices. For example, you can create a physical image, or bit-for-bit copy of a storage media, to duplicate the contents, including information that might still be present but whose pointers were removed.

Therefore, it is common that the detection of an incident happens when consequences are evident, for instance when a document is leaked or when they are locked out of their online accounts. Due to the limitation in resources, it is also uncommon for organizations to have digital security specialists among their team, which means many of the digital security tasks fall on internal technology or communication teams, assisted frequently by external specialized helplines or consultants. </p> <p>When an individual or an organization detects a potential incident, either through a suspicious behavior or through an alert (for example, apple threat notifications), the helpline or the digital security point of contact starts a process to investigate and triage the situation, to understand what happened, when it happened and what actions have been taken so far. From these initial steps, it is important that the incident handler, in addition to considering and assessing the wellbeing of the victim, incorporates digital forensic best practices to protect and collect evidence that could potentially be helpful for accountability purposes. </p> <p>As it was mentioned above, incident response and digital forensic processes are closely intertwined. It is during that initial response that the incident handler identifies which systems, devices or accounts might contain useful evidence for a forensic investigation. It\u2019s worth highlighting that in our context, forensic investigations should always be consensual, which implies that before collecting any data we should provide clear information about what the process entails and what the goal is, ideally through a written form. </p> <p>Figuring out exactly what to collect depends on several factors, including the willingness of the at-risk person to share information, the type of incident, the tools and resources available, the technical proficiency of the person doing the collection, among others. In some cases, the incident handler or point of contact can do an initial triage and collection, and work in collaboration with trusted third parties to further examine the data and identify signs and indicators of compromise. While deep technical proficiency is not required to do the collection of evidence and artifacts, it is important that whoever is doing the collection understands key concepts and considerations like the ones included in this resource. </p> <p>For example, in some instances it is counterproductive to turn off and ship a device to a 3rd party forensic laboratory for analysis. This would likely destroy useful volatile evidence \u2013data that is altered or destroyed when manipulating or shutting off a device. If we want to collect this type of data, it is more convenient to use forensic tools that allow a live collection that includes information like running processes, temporary files, etc. </p> <p>Buenas Pr\u00e1cticas</p> <p>Throughout this forensic process, one of the most important aspects is keeping a good chronological documentation of actions taken, evidence collected, hashes, tools used, issues faced, consent, etc. </p> <p>In most cases, evidence can not be deeply analyzed on site, and additional forensic tools, manual analysis and research are necessary to establish conclusions about what might have occurred. This offsite analysis is often conducted by analysts with deeper knowledge and understanding of the operating systems in question, and also have access to tools, indicators and methodologies for analysis. </p> <p>It is possible that the initial analysis does not provide any immediate result or match with known signatures, especially if this analysis rellies only on known vulnerabilities and if we suspect an advanced threat actor is involved, that could engage in efforts to delete traces of their activity. It is also possible that attackers use techniques to disrupt or hinder forensic analysis efforts, on what is commonly known as anti-forensics. </p> <p>Therefore, not getting an immediate result does not mean that we can fully guarantee the device has not been targeted or compromised, both because of anti-forensic techniques as well as limitations on access to useful forensic artifacts or threat intelligence . Moreover, threat actors often move dynamically, meaning that they sometimes do not maintain persistent access to devices. Finding the footprints of a threat actor using automated analysis tools often requires access to threat intelligence (in the form of indicators of compromise) that can be used to compare against our local collection. Additional manual analysis can take place to try and identify patterns and logs of potential new exploits and vectors of compromise. The IOCs and skills necessary for the discovery of new attacks might not always be readily available, and sometimes it might be helpful to store forensic evidence for additional study and investigation further down the road. This should always be done in clear consent with the victim, and making sure data management and data security policies are being followed. </p> <p>During the last 5 years, different projects and funds have invigorated a global community of forensic analysts, including with a few emerging laboratories across in the global majority. This has increased local capacities, but it is still crucial that collaboration remains at the center of all these efforts. Peer-to-peer support, within regions and globally, is fundamental for the collective success, including through greater sharing of threat information as well as building of skills and knowledge. The establishment of a forensic lab is usually the first step in a process that can take several years to mature, and where collaboration is key for long-term sustainability. </p>","tags":["explainer","intro"]},{"location":"explainers/01-explainer-introduction-digital-forensics/01-explainer-introduction-digital-forensics/#important-considerations-when-conducting-forensic-investigations","title":"Important considerations when conducting forensic investigations","text":"<p>Below we detail a few important aspects to keep in mind when conducting forensic investigations in support of at-risk users from civil society. </p>","tags":["explainer","intro"]},{"location":"explainers/01-explainer-introduction-digital-forensics/01-explainer-introduction-digital-forensics/#informed-consent","title":"Informed consent","text":"<p>Different from forensic investigations in other contexts (judicial, corporate), forensic investigations in support of Human Rights Defenders should always be consented.

In the context of consented forensics analysis in civil society, it relates to the agreement and acceptance of actions required for collection, preservation and presentation of digital evidence. </p> <p>A key aspect of a consent agreement is the capacity of the person who signs and accepts the risk to take an informed decision on the course of the investigation, or even reject the assistance. In the forensic field, this means providing enough information so that the beneficiary of support understands what actions, risks, rights and responsibilities are part of the investigation process. Informed consent is not just about signing a form, but a process led by the analyst or the forensic lab to communicate in a clear and transparent way with the beneficiary of support, and ensure their will is respected. </p> <p>One of the reasons consent is necessary is related to the fact that digital evidence might include personal information, like contacts, files, pictures, applications, etc. This can carry risks, in case the information is exposed or not managed properly, and potentially could be subject to data protection regulation (GDPR, for example). In addition to communicating transparently about what is collected, forensic labs should make their best effort to reduce the collection of personal data, and to protect sensitive information with robust security policies. </p> <p>Consideraci\u00f3n Legal</p> <p>Any data that is collected will be subject to data protection legislation of the local jurisdiction of residence of whoever is requesting the forensic analysis. </p> <p>Moreover, depending on the focus of the organization providing the support and the nature of the investigation, there might be different approaches to presenting the results of the analysis. Often, forensic research leads to reports, campaigns, litigation efforts and other interventions that seek greater accountability. These actions and interventions can create risks, both for the organization conducting the research and for the victims, including legal prosecution, harassment and retaliation from governments or private companies. Before naming or using someone\u2019s evidence as part of an accountability action, it is important to ensure there is informed consent. </p> <p>Even in situations where there is no intent to publish results or initiate legal cases from the forensic evidence, there is both a risk and responsibility when collecting information for forensic purposes. Therefore, it is important that both parties (the analyst and the person asking for the analysis) identify possible risks, and agree on what information will be collected and how it will be used, so that risks can be acknowledged and minimized where possible. </p> <p>As part of this process, the forensic analyst or threat lab should also point and explain any expectations, policies or terms of services that are associated with the provision of support. For example, an organization might ask beneficiaries of support not to speak publicly about their involvement or assistance to protect their staff. Access Now Helpline and Amnesty Tech have published terms or service and privacy policies that might be useful as reference. </p>","tags":["how-to","intro"]},{"location":"how-tos/01-how-to-obtain-informed-consent/01-how-to-obtain-informed-consent/#origin-and-application-of-informed-consent-in-forensic-investigations","title":"Origin and application of informed consent in forensic investigations","text":"<p>Informed consent is not a practice exclusive to digital forensics. Some type of informed consent is usually required before agreeing to certain medical procedures, when being part of a scientific study or generally when engaging in activities that require the acknowledgment of a certain risk (think about skydiving and bungee jumping). </p> <p>Some of the origins of consent track back to medicine. In the medical context, informed consent implies providing the patient with sufficient information about a given treatment, including risks, potential benefits, alternatives, expected results, among others. Ensuring that consent is well informed is an ethical and legal responsibility of medicine practitioners. </p> <p>When engaging in a forensic investigation to support an individual or organization from civil society, the process of obtaining consent should clarify aspects like: </p> <ul> <li>What information is being collected?
