To organize the contents, we use the technical documentation framework Di\u00e1taxis. </p> <p>Digital forensics makes possible the discovery and examination of digital data and media with the goal of identifying, documenting and interpreting data to construct and present reproducible evidence of digital attacks. In this repository we describe standard procedures, aligned with industry best practices, to generate evidence that can be used to to promote accountability actions, in order to reduce and expose the impunity with which digital attacks are carried out. </p>"},{"location":"#who-is-this-repository-for","title":"\u00bfWho is this repository for?","text":"<p>The information included in this repository can be useful to individuals with different profiles, including: </p> <ul> <li>Contact points and intermediaries (individuals with basic technical competences)   </li> <li>Security incident handlers for civil society  </li> <li>Threat lab analysts  </li> <li>Managers and coordinators of threat labs</li> </ul> <p>We expect that any person with a basic technical capacity can follow resources in this repository to understand key concepts of consensual forensic analysis, as well as procedures to identify and acquire forensic evidence. </p> <p>The resources focused on the analysis of evidence and presentation of results are geared towards forensic analysts, specially those within emerging or established threat labs, since they require additional technical competencies and a well-thought risk management plan. </p>"},{"location":"#how-is-this-repository-organized","title":"\u00bfHow is this repository organized?","text":"<p>To organize this repository we follow the technical documentation framework Diataxis, that defines four different types of resources: tutorials, how-to\u2019s, explainers and references. </p>"},{"location":"#tutorials","title":"Tutorials","text":"<p>Tutorials are all about learning through guided practical exercises. In other words, it's learning by doing. Tutorials allow the reader to acquire skills and knowledge, and are focused on learning and not on completing a specific task. </p> <p>An example of a tutorial is a car driving lesson. Usually, in a good driving lesson students familiarize themselves with the vehicle, the controls, and learn as they go.

They focus on a defined scope of a larger topic, and usually help understand the \u201cwhy\u201d. </p> <p>For example, the first explainer included in this documentation repository presents information about the larger forensic science field, and how consensual digital forensics for civil society fit in the larger scheme of things while also touching on the importance as a mechanism for accountability. </p>"},{"location":"#how-tos","title":"How-to\u2019s","text":"<p>How-to\u2019s are all about executing a task and achieving a goal through step-by-step instructions.
