This project is focused on strengthening consensual forensic analysis capabilities in high-risk civil society contexts. Consequently, contributions will **not** be accepted if they:

* Include functionalities that **violate digital rights**  
* Introduce code that **jeopardizes the integrity or privacy of sensitive data**  
* Create **ambiguities** concerning the intended use of the tool  
* Introduce **undocumented tools or tools with legal implications** without sufficient context
