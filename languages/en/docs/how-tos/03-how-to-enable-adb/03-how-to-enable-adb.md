# How to enable ADB on an Android device?

This resource falls under the **[how-to guides](../index.md)** and **presents the steps to enable USB debugging**, also known as Android Debug Bridge or ADB, on different Android devices. It also provides a **brief explanation of what USB debugging** is and **why it is useful** in digital forensics. This is introductory material, complementary to other resources such as the explainer on log-based forensics for Android devices and the guide on enabling developer options, and is part of the steps to follow when making an acquisition of forensic evidence from an Android device. 

**We appreciate the collaboration of [RSF Security Lab](https://rsf.org/en/digital-security-lab)**, who provided us with a set of guides and screenshots that enabled the development of this resource. 


## What is ADB or USB debugging, and why is it useful?

ADB stands for [Android Debug Bridge](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb). It is a **command-line tool** that allows direct communication with an Android device over USB, enabling the execution of various actions and commands.

From a digital forensics perspective, particularly in log-based investigations using tools such as AndroidQF, ADB enables **establishing a direct connection with a device**. It is useful in situations where physical access to the device is available and when **the goal is to obtain information directly from the device** using native commands, without relying on additional tools. ADB or USB debugging is **also necessary to complete an extraction using AndroidQF**. 


## How to enable ADB?

In most cases, **USB debugging or ADB can be found within the Developer Options menu**. Therefore, if this menu has not yet been enabled, you should first follow the [relevant instructions for enabling it](../02-how-to-enable-developer-options/02-how-to-enable-developer-options.md).

The following section provides **step-by-step instructions for enabling ADB on different Android models** and versions.

??? question "Why is ADB enabled differently on Android devices?"

    The Android operating system is based on the [*Android Open Source Project*](https://source.android.com/)*.* However, most manufacturers [use a propietary version developed by Google](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/android-really-open-source-matter/), on top of which manufacturers add personalization layers.

## Conclusion

**ADB**, or Android Debug Bridge, is a **native Android command-line tool that allows direct interaction with a device**. In forensic analysis contexts, it can be useful for obtaining information that supports triage without the need for third-party tools.

Due to the wide variety of manufacturers and Android operating system versions, this guide presents a **list of manufacturers and step-by-step instructions to enable ADB**, helping facilitate and promote consent-based forensic analysis in support of civil society.
