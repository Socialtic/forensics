# Reference

In this section you will find references. According to [Diataxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr) reference material describes the machinery. It should be austere. **One hardly reads reference material; one consults it**. There should be no doubt or ambiguity in reference; it should be wholly authoritative. Reference contains technical knowledge that can be helpful when executing a task. 

A good example of a reference is a map. It is a clear, neutral and precise resource that serves as support when completing a task, in this case getting from point A to point B.
