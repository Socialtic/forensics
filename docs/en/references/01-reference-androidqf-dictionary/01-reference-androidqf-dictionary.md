# AndroidQF output file dictionary

This document is part of a **technical documentation repository** whose main objective is to establish a baseline of proven, flexible and accessible knowledge to **boost consensual forensic analysis in support of civil society across the globe**. To organize the contents, we use the [technical documentation framework Diátaxis](../00-glossary.md#diataxis). 

This particular resource fits within [the reference category in Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/reference/), and contains information about files generated by the tool [androidqf](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf) when conducting a forensic extraction of an Android device. The objective is to **facilitate the understanding of the resulting files, including what information is included and why it could be helpful from a forensic standpoint**. 

This resource was last updated on June 16, 2025, and for the presentation of the information we based our [version 1.7.1](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/tree/v1.7.1). This resource was originally developed in Spanish, and translated with the support of Marianne Parrott. 

[Androidqf](../00-glossary.md#androidqf) is a forensic extraction tool, part of the [Mobile Verification Toolkit (MVT) project](../00-glossary.md#mvt). It is maintained by  [Amnesty International Security Lab.](https://securitylab.amnesty.org/)   

The name of the tool emerges from Android Quick Forensics. It is a **[portable tool](../00-glossary.md#portable-tool)**, which means it can be executed on Windows, GNU/Linux and MacOS with a precompiled binary, without requiring an installation. This simplifies the acquisition of key forensic information from Android devices, specially in remote scenarios. 

The information generated by androidqf can be **grouped into 5 main categories**: 

* Acquisition and extraction  
* Device information and configuration  
* System logs and events  
* Processes and applications  
* Information backed up from the device 

## Acquisition and extraction

### acquisition.json

The information in this file is generated by the [acquisition.go](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/blob/main/acquisition/acquisition.go) module.

**What is included in this file?** 

This file is in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format and records information related to the data acquisition process of the device. It contains the following details: 

* UUID of the extraction, which is also used as the name of the folder where the information is stored.  
* Version of androidqf.  
* Location where the extraction is stored.  
* Date and time of start and end of the acquisition.  
* Information of the collector binary used.  
* Information of the ADB binary used.  
* Location of the SD card storage.  
* CPU architecture of the device. 

**Why is this important?**

This file provides general information about the extraction and the device, including unique identifiers that can be helpful to ensure the chain of custody of the forensic evidence. 

**Example:**

```
{
 "uuid": "0f615832-ed22-411e-9317-b429d28ecf9a",
 "androidqf_version": "v1.7.0-1-gf7642bf",
 "storage_path": "/home/user/0f615832-ed22-411e-9317-b429d28ecf9a",
 "started": "2025-01-01T18:36:37.443498116Z",
 "completed": "2025-01-01T18:50:04.947856405Z",
 "collector": {
  "ExePath": "/data/local/tmp/collector",
  "Installed": false,
  "Adb": {
   "ExePath": "/usr/bin/adb",
  },
  "Architecture": "arm64-v8a"
 },
 "tmp_dir": "/data/local/tmp/",
 "sdcard": "/sdcard/",
 "cpu": "arm64-v8a"
}
```

### **command.log**

The information in this file is generated by the [logger.go](http://logger.go). This module presents detailed logs of the acquisition process of the device. 

**What is included in this file?** 

This file is in plain text with a .log extension and contains a record of the commands executed during data acquisition. It documents each command used (DEBUG) and its output on screen (INFO), warning messages (WARNING) and error messages (ERROR) during execution. It uses the following structure: 

* Date and time of the command or message  
* Type of message  
* Content of the message

**Why is this important?**

This file presents a log of the actions performed by the app during the data acquisition process. This allows the analyst to verify the completeness of the extraction, to ensure all steps were performed. In case of errors, it also provides information to debug and fix potential issues. 

**Example:**

```

### **hashes.csv**

The information in this file is generated by the [*HashFiles*](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/blob/main/acquisition/acquisition.go#L134) function of the [acquisition.go](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/blob/main/acquisition/acquisition.go) module.

**What is included in this file?** 

This file is in [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) format and stores the [SHA-256](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2)  hashes for each file generated during extraction or extracted from the device. It uses the following format: 

* File name and location  
* Hash value using SHA-256

**Why is this important?** 

The hashes help to guarantee the integrity of the information and ensure that it has not been modified after acquisition, facilitating independent verification and chain of custody. 

**Example:**

## Device information and configuration

### getprop.txt

The information in this file is generated by the [getprop.go](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/blob/main/modules/getprop.go) module. 

**What is included in this file?** 

This file is in TXT format and contains the output of the `adb getprop` command, which details the **system properties**.

System properties are key-value pairs of strings that are stored in the global [*build.prop*](https://xdaforums.com/t/guide-build-prop-wiki.2056266/) dictionary or in *.sysprop* files, and provide a convenient way to share information, usually settings, throughout the system.

The information can be found in the following format:

```
[{prefix}.]{group}[.{subgroup}]*.{name}[.{type}]
```

The prefix *ro* is used for read-only configurations, or settings that have been set after the last reboot. The prefix prefix *persist* is used for configurations that are persistent after a reboot. It is also possible that properties do not have a prefix, meaning they begin directly with the group they belong to. 

The most common groups are:

* *bluetooth*, Bluetooth related  
* *boot*, sysprops from kernel cmdline  
* *build*, sysprops that identify a build  
* *telephony*, telephony related  
* *audio*, audio related  
* *graphics*, graphics related  
* *vold*, vold related 

For more details, see the [list of properties already defined in the Android source code](https://oneamnesty-my.sharepoint.com/personal/marianne_parrott_amnesty_org/Documents/Downloads/lista%20de%20propiedades%20ya%20definidas%20en%20el%20c%C3%B3digo%20fuente%20de%20Android).

**Why is this important?**

The properties provide important information about the device's hardware and software, which can be altered by malicious software to hide its presence or to inadvertently modify the device's behaviour.

**Example:**

```

### **selinux.txt**

The information in this file is generated by the [selinux.go](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/blob/main/modules/selinux.go) module.

**What is included in this file?** 

This file is in TXT format and contains the output of the `adb shell getenforce` command. It indicates the *SELinux* security policy applied on the device, indicating the mode that it is in (*enforcing*, *permissive*, or *disabled*).

**Why is this important?**

[*SELinux*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-Enhanced_Linux) is a key security layer in Android. Changes to its configuration can be an indication of compromises to the security of the device.

**Example:**

```
Enforcing
```

### settings\_global.txt

The information in this file is generated by the [settings.go](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/blob/main/modules/settings.go) module.

**What is included in this file?** 

This file is in TXT format and contains the output of the `adb shell cmd settings list global` command, which shows preferences that always apply identically to all defined users ([well-defined user](https://source.android.com/docs/devices/admin/multi-user#user_types)). Apps can read them, but cannot write them. These are preferences that the user must explicitly modify via the system user interface or APIs specialized in these values.

These settings include development settings, boot count, and Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and telephony connection status. For the [complete list of global preferences](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.Global), please refer to the relevant Android documentation.

**Why is this important?**

It allows the identification of anomalous settings that could compromise the security, privacy or functionality of the device. Unusual default settings may signal intentional or accidental attempts to modify system behaviour.

**Example:**

```
Phenotype_boot_count=68
adb_enabled=1
airplane_mode_on=0
bluetooth_on=1
boot_count=71
bug_report=0
default_device_name=Galaxy A14 5G

### settings\_secure.txt

The information in this file is generated by the [settings.go](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/blob/main/modules/settings.go) module.

**What is included in this file?** 

This file is in TXT format and contains the output of the `adb shell cmd settings list secure` command, which displays system security preferences that apps can read but not write. These are preferences that the user must explicitly modify through the user interface of a system app. Normal apps cannot modify the security settings database.

These settings include development settings, accessibility, location, data entry, screen lock, parental controls, text-to-speech, and Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and telephony connection.

For the [complete list of security preferences](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.Secure), please refer to the relevant Android documentation.

**Why is this important?**

It allows the identification of anomalous settings that could compromise the security, privacy or functionality of the device. Unusual default settings may signal intentional or accidental attempts to modify system behaviour.

**Example:**

```
accessibility_allow_diagonal_scrolling=1

### **env.txt**

The information in this file is generated by the [env.go](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/blob/main/modules/env.go) module.

**What is included in this file?** 

This file is in TXT format and contains the output of the `adb shell env` command, which shows the configuration of the [*mkshrc*](http://mirbsd.de/mksh) (shell) environment variables used by Android.

By default, the *mkshrc* variables in Android are found in the *mkshrc* or *profile* file which can be in one of the following directories.

```
/system/etc
/system/etc/profile
$HOME/
/data/local
```

The [*mkshrc* binary can be found in one of the following directories](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic/+/refs/heads/master/libc/include/paths.h#50).

```
/product/bin
/apex/com.android.runtime/bin
/apex/com.android.art/bin
/system_ext/bin
/system/bin
/system/xbin
/odm/bin
/vendor/bin
/vendor/xbin
```

The variables contained in the file may indicate:

* Partition locations  
* Android virtual machine runtime environment values  
* Shell settings

**Why is this important?**

Environment variables may indicate changes in the settings of the terminal, the command shell, the Android virtual machine runtime environment or the mount points of some partitions and folders. This could indicate suspicious behaviour on the device for the execution of malicious software.

**Example:**

```
_=/system/bin/env
ANDROID_DATA=/data

The information in this file is generated by the [processes.go](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/blob/main/modules/processes.go) module. 

**What is included in this file?** 

This file is in *JSON* format and contains the output of the command `adb shell ps -A` which provides detailed information about the process being executed on the device. 

**Why is this important?**

This file provides additional information about the processes that are executed in the device. Information about processes is sometimes available as part of IOC of certain malicious activities, and it is also helpful to analyze apps and processes in depth, understanding relationships between them (by exploring parent processes), among other characteristics.

### root\_binaries.json

The information on this file is generated by the [root\_binaries.go](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/blob/main/modules/root_binaries.go) module, and is intended to provide guidance on whether the device is running with root privileges or not. 

**What is included in this file?** 

This file is in *json* format and contains the output of the command `adb shell which -a` applied to a list of binaries to determine whether they are present on the system or not. 

The binaries included are commonly used to obtain root access, or to elevate privileges in the system. The list of binaries that is checked using this command is the following: 

* su  
* busybox  
* supersu  
* Superuser.apk  
* KingoUser.apk  
* SuperSu.apk  
* magisk  
* magiskhide  
* magiskinit  
* magiskpolicy

If none of these files is present in the system, then the content of the file will be empty. 

**Why is this important?**

This file can help detect tools used to obtain root access on the device. This might be an indication of unauthorized access or an escalation of privileges. It might also be an indication that the phone was rooted by the owner. The command provides also a list of the binaries found, which can be helpful to understand how it was rooted. 

**Example:** 

In case the device is not rooted, the output will be something like: 

```
[]
```

In case the device is rooted, the command will provide a list of the binaries found: 

```
[
	"/system/xbin/su",
	"/system/bin/su",
	"/data/local/xbin/su",
	"/data/local/bin/busybox",
	"/sbin/su",
	"/su/bin/magisk",
	"/system/bin/.ext/.su",
	"/data/local/tmp/Superuser.apk",
	"/data/local/tmp/magiskhide"
]


```

## Information backed up from the device

### backup.ab

The information on this file is generated by the [backup.go](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/blob/main/modules/backup.go) module. This module is specifically designed to create security copies of data stored on Android devices. 

**What is included in this file?** 

This is a binary file, and contains data extracted using the command `adb backup` using parameters depending on the options selected from: “only SMS”, “everything” or “no backup”. These binary files might contain personal information. 

The resulting file can be analyzed using [MVT](https://github.com/mvt-project/mvt) through the command `mvt-android check-backup backup.ab`

**Why is this important?**

When SMS backup is allowed, the information from the SMS messages can be used to locate potential malicious links or other indicators of compromise. 

**Example:** 

```
(Binary data containing app backups and settings)

**What is included in this file?** 

This is a file in *json* format that contains the result of using the find command to gather information about specific system locations.  The exact command used is as follows  `adb shell find '/' -maxdepth 1 -printf '%T@ %m %s %u %g %p\n' 2\> /dev/null`  and it is applied on the following folders: 

* /sdcard/  
* /system/  
* /system\_ext/  
* /vendor/  
* /cust/  
* /product/  
* /apex/
