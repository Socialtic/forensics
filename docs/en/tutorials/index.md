# Tutorials

In this section you will find Tutorials. According to [Diataxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/tutorials) tutorials are all about learning through **guided practical exercises**. In other words, it's **learning by doing**. Tutorials allow the reader to acquire skills and knowledge, and are focused on learning and not on completing a specific task. 

An example of a tutorial is a car driving lesson. Usually, in a good driving lesson students familiarize themselves with the vehicle, the controls, and learn as they go. The **objective is not getting from going A to point B, instead is the skills you learn in the way.**
