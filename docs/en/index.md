# Documentation repository on consensual digital forensics for the defense of Human Rights 


This is a **technical documentation repository** whose main objective is to establish a baseline of proven, flexible and accessible knowledge to **boost consensual forensic analysis in support of civil society across the globe**. To organize the contents, we use [the technical documentation framework Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/). 

Digital forensics makes possible the **discovery and examination of digital data and media** with the goal of identifying, documenting and interpreting data to construct and present reproducible evidence of digital attacks. In this repository we describe standard procedures, aligned with industry best practices, to **generate evidence that can be used to to promote accountability actions**, in order to reduce and expose the impunity with which digital attacks are carried out.
