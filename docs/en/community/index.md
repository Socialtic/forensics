# Community on consensual forensics for the defense of human rights


This repository aims to **promote consensual forensic analysis within civil society for the defense of human rights** through proven, flexible, and accessible knowledge generated by an entire community of practice. For **over a decade**, organizations such as [Citizen Lab](https://citizenlab.ca/category/research/targeted-threats/) and the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/issues/state-sponsored-malware) (EFF) have **applied forensic science in consensual environments** to uncover the **use of surveillance technologies against at-risk individuals in civil society.**

In recent years, **new initiatives have emerged** seeking greater accountability for digital attacks. Organizations from the Global North—such as [Amnesty International](https://securitylab.amnesty.org/), [Access Now](https://www.accessnow.org/help/helpline-services/), [Reporters Without Borders](https://rsf.org/en/rsf-launches-digital-security-lab), among others—have launched their own forensic labs. At the same time, labs in the global **majority** have also exposed **abuses against civil society**. Many of these labs come together in networks like [CiviCERT](https://www.civicert.org/) or regional communities.

We believe it is **essential to encourage and support more organizations in integrating forensic science into their investigation and incident response efforts**. At the same time, we understand that completing a forensic analysis that results in accountability actions r**equires a minimum level of operational maturity and technical capability**. This repository seeks to collect, share, and promote this knowledge, especially among labs in the Global Majority, in **order to build a solid and common foundation that fosters practical collaborations.**

It is important to note that **theoretical and practical knowledge is just one of the many elements required** to produce a solid technical analysis. In addition, it is necessary to establish a relationship of **trust** with affected individuals, implement **strong procedures** (such as those related to informed consent), **understand risks**, foster **collaboration**, and follow good **operational security** practices, among others.

Developing these skills and capacities **takes time and resources**, which are often limited within civil society, specially in the global majority. This is why **collaboration and working together** are the best tactics to **exchange knowledge and experiences.** If you are a civil society organization and are interested in integrating forensic processes into your work—or in investigating the possible use of surveillance technologies in your region—you can contact us at **seguridad@socialtic.org** to discuss important considerations and identify the best way to strengthen your capacities.
