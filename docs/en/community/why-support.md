This repository tries to collect **knowledge and experiences of an entire community of practice**. The development of contents is led by the [civil society organization SocialTIC](https://socialtic.org/), but the intention is that the materials **accurately reflect the techniques and practices of analysts and researchers in the field**; focusing throughout on particularities and considerations of applying forensics for the defense of human rights.  Gathering and maintaining these collective learnings up to date requires a collective effort that, coincidentally, helps align the contents with the actual needs of the **communities who consult them**. 

Through **community contributions**, we can:

* Detect, discuss and correct **mistakes, gaps or omissions**  
* **Update content** to reflect new versions of tools or operating systems  
* Suggest **new topics, resources** or structure learning paths  
* **Translate**, localize or adapt materials to field needs  
* Strengthen the project’s documentation and **accessibility**

**Sharing and generating knowledge** to catalyze the use of digital technologies—including their application to forensic science—is [**part of SocialTIC’s mission**](https://socialtic.org/quienes-somos/). This repository **complements other capacity building activities we’ve carried out**, where we have identified the need to provide additional resources to support the **learning and application of forensic techniques**.

Despite some valuable efforts in recent years, **existing resources to train forensic analysts in civil society are still insufficient to meet the needs of at-risk communities**—especially for labs in the global majority. This limitation, combined with the **procedural and technical complexity of a forensic investigation**, means that the vast majority of digital security incidents affecting Human Rights Defenders **get no accountability** at all. 

Beyond these technical and procedural challenges, and in light of the [**difficult global context**](https://www.civicus.org/documents/reports-and-publications/SOCS/2025/state-of-civil-society-report-2025_en.pdf)**,** at SocialTIC we believe that collaboration can empower helplines, analysts, trainers and digital security contacts with foundational knowledge that **enables them to navigate the initial stages of a forensic investigation** while adhering to best practices. Strengthening this baseline will **foster deeper collaboration** with more **mature** forensic laboratories, which in turn will positively impact the **long-term ability to produce independent technical analysis**.
