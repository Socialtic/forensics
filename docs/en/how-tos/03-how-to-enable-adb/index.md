# How to enable ADB on an Android device?

This resource falls under the **[how-to guides](../)** category and **presents the steps to enable USB debugging**, also known as Android Debug Bridge or ADB, on different Android devices. It also provides a **brief explanation of what USB debugging** is and **why it is useful** in digital forensics. This is introductory material, complementary to other resources such as the [explainer on log-based forensics for Android devices](../../explainers/03-explainer-log-forensics-android/index.md) and the guide on enabling developer options, and is part of the steps to follow when making an acquisition of forensic evidence from an Android device. 

**We appreciate the collaboration of [RSF Security Lab](https://rsf.org/en/digital-security-lab)**, who provided us with a set of guides and screenshots that enabled the development of this resource. 


## What is ADB or USB debugging, and why is it useful?

ADB stands for [Android Debug Bridge](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb). It is a **command-line tool** that allows direct communication with an Android device over USB, enabling the execution of various actions and commands.

From a digital forensics perspective, particularly in log-based investigations using tools such as [AndroidQF](../../references/00-glossary/index.md#androidqf), ADB enables **establishing a direct connection with a device**. It is useful in situations where physical access to the device is available and when **the goal is to obtain information directly from the device** using native commands, without relying on additional tools. ADB or USB debugging is **also necessary to complete an extraction using AndroidQF**. 


## How to enable ADB?

In most cases, **USB debugging or ADB can be found within the Developer Options menu**. Therefore, if this menu has not yet been enabled, you should first follow the [relevant instructions for enabling it](../02-how-to-enable-developer-options/index.md).

The following section provides **step-by-step instructions for enabling ADB on different Android models** and versions.

??? question "Why is ADB enabled differently on Android devices?"

    The Android operating system is based on the [*Android Open Source Project*](https://source.android.com/)*.* However, most manufacturers [use a proprietary version developed by Google](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/android-really-open-source-matter/), on top of which manufacturers add personalization layers. 

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Read more here](../02-how-to-enable-developer-options/index.md#why-are-there-different-ways-to-enable-them) 

The following section shows the steps to **enable ADB on different devices**, along with screenshots of the relevant menus for each interface.

### Other devices
	
If your device is not listed above, **USB debugging** is usually the first option inside the **Developer Options** menu. You can also type **USB debugging** in the search bar of the **Settings** menu to find it.

## How to disable ADB?
	
Once the acquisition is finished, it is a good practice to **disable USB debugging**, so that the device returns to its original state. To do so, follow these steps:
	
1. Open the **Developer Options** menu, in the same location used to enable USB debugging 🤖
2. **Turn off** the option **USB debugging** ⛔
	
If you no longer need the developer options menu, you can also [disable developer options](../02-how-to-enable-developer-options/index.md#how-to-disable-developer-options), which turns off USB debugging as well.

## Conclusion

**ADB**, or Android Debug Bridge, is a **native Android command-line tool that allows direct interaction with a device**. In forensic analysis contexts, it can be useful for obtaining information that supports triage without the need for third-party tools.

Due to the wide variety of manufacturers and Android operating system versions, this guide presents a **list of manufacturers and step-by-step instructions to enable ADB**, helping facilitate and promote consent-based forensic analysis in support of civil society.
