# How-To Guides

In this section you will find how-to guides. According to [Diataxis documentation framework](../references/00-glossary.md#diataxis) **how-toâ€™s are all about executing a task and achieving a goal** through step-by-step instructions. It assumes that the reader already has the baseline skills and knowledge necessary to complete the task, and hence, focuses on the steps necessary to achieve the desired outcome in a correct way and aligned to best practices. 

A good example is a cooking recipe, where the focus is to achieve a result, in this case preparing a specific dish in a repeatable way. It assumes the person already has basic knowledge on aspects like cutting and measuring the ingredients, setting the oven temperature, etc.
