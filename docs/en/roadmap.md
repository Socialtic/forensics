# Roadmap

## Publication strategy

In the first phase of this repository, we will focus on contains that allow readers to attain a baseline **understanding of consensual digital forensics, as well as tutorials and guides to support evidence collection**. Down the road, we will focus on contents related to the **analysis phase, as well as resources to support peer collaboration**. 

Contents will be developed in **Spanish first**, and we will pursue and support translation to English. In advance **we appreciate any and all efforts to revise, improve and translate contents into different languages**. For more information, you can get in touch with us at [seguridad@socialtic.org](mailto:seguridad@socialtic.org). 


## Additional contents to be developed

Over the coming months, we expect to publish contents in the following topics. We are indicating the approximate time of the year contents will be released, but please keep in mind that the exact timeline might shift due to internal and external priorities. If you are interested in any specific content to be released sooner than we are planning to, don’t hesitate to reach out and let us know at  [seguridad@socialtic.org](mailto:seguridad@socialtic.org).
